<p><b><a name="1.2"></a>1.1 Foreword</b></p>

<p>     I wrote this HOWTO because I felt the official Hack 

  FAQ was lacking in some basic information and the information at the AVS forum 

  was far too spread out.  Rather than make people cull all the ppp-over-serial 

  information together, I though I would lay out step-by-step how to do it, all 

  in one big document.</p>

<p><b><a name="1.2"></a>1.2 Requirements</b></p>

<p>     This document assumes a few basic things.  First and foremost, you should 
  have read the <a href="http://tivo.samba.org">TiVo Hack FAQ located at http://tivo.samba.org</a>.  
  The Hack FAQ is the &quot;official&quot; repository of information regarding 
  hacking your TiVo.  I also highly recommend browsing the <a href="http://www.avsforums.com">TiVo 
  Underground forums at http://www.avsforums.com</a>.  This document is built 
  almost entirely based on information found at those two locations.  You should 
  also have basic understanding of Linux or one of its variants. Lastly, I have 
  only tested this on Philip's 30 hour TiVo, US version, with version 1.3 and 
  2.01 of the software.  U.K. and/or Sony models may or may not work (but should...). 
  Also, this this document assumes you will be using Linux for the internet gateway. 
  Other OS's (such as Windows 2000) will work, but you're on your own for configuration.</p>
<p>     Since you will be updating over the internet, this document will also 
  assume that the linux computer you are connecting to is already configured as 
  a valid gateway and already has a working connection to the internet. If not, 
  I recommend you check out the various Networking HOWTO's, especially the Home-Networking-mini-HOWTO, 
  the IP-MASQ HOWTO and the IPCHAINS-HOWTO (firewall). These HOWTO's are included 
  with most linux distributions. They can also be found at the Linux Documentation 
  Project at <a href="http://howto.tucows.com">http://www.linuxdoc.org</a> (among 
  other places).

<p><b><a name="2.1"></a>2.1  Connecting your serial port</b></p>

<p>     Your TiVo should have come with a cable that has a mini-stereo connector 
  on one end and a 9-pin connector on the other end.  To connect this to your 
  linux PC (or whatever you'll use), you'll need a null-modem adapter and a probably 
  a gender changer.  It's just a simple serial connection. If you want to get 
  tricky and make your own cables for whatever reason (server in another part 
  of the house, for example), it's pretty easy. Here is a DB-9 RS232 pinout reference 
  table that you may find useful:</p>

<p>     There are only three wires to worry about: RX, TX, and GND. You don't 
  even need to bother wiring the rest of the pins. On the TiVo side, the mini-stereo 
  (TRS mini-plug) connector is wired like this:</p>
<p>Tip to Pin 3 (TX)<br>
  Ring to Pin 2 (RX)<br>
  Sleeve to Pin 5 (GND)</p>
<p>     If you make your own wire, you'll want to swap RX and TX on one of the 
  ends (make Pin 2 TX and Pin 3 RX) so you won't need a null-modem adapter. You 
  can buy bulk wire and all the connectors (TRS mini-plugs, unwired DB9 adaptors, 
  etc.) from any decent electronics supply house. I recommend using CAT5 due to 
  its superior signal-carrying quality. It can also be used for other purposes 
  such as telephones and 100Base-T networking, so if you ever get rid of your 
  TiVo (shya, RIGHT!) the cable can be re-used. If you go the CAT5 route, the 
  TX and RX should be on a different pair, with the second wire of each pair going 
  to GND. This will help reduce crosstalk and allow for cleaner, longer runs.</p>
<p>      For mine, I bought two DB-9 adapters and wired them with cross-over serial 
  pinouts (swapped Pins 2&amp;3 on one of the adapters) and ran CAT5 twisted pair 
  cable between them so it would reach all the way into my server room, then I 
  connected it to the DB9/TRS cable that came with the TiVo to complete the connection.</p>

<b><a name="2.2"></a>2.2 Getting a bash prompt </b> 
<p>     There are two ways to get a prompt with version 2.x of the TiVo software. 
  The first way *requires* that you've already hacked v1.3 on your TiVo. Since 
  it involves fiddling with the partitions and the &quot;myworld&quot; program, 
  I personally consider it to be a bit dangerous, so I won't go into it in this 
  document. If you choose to go that route, though, here's a hint: You'll need 
  to put &quot;run myworld=false&quot; in the diagnostic mode boot paramters line, 
  then temporarily swap the two main root partitions to boot from the old partition 
  to make your changes. If you don't know what that means, you don't have any 
  business messing around there.</p>
<p>     The second way (and the only way if you've never hacked your TiVo before) 
  is to take the cover off your TiVo, remove the drive, and mount it in a handy 
  spare computer.<b> Be advised that this *will* void your warranty. Do this at 
  your own risk.</b> <br>
</p>
<p>     I won't go into too much detail here, the Hack FAQ is much better at explaining 
  this part than I am.  What you'll need to do is access the TiVo's diagnostic 
  mode.  It's a little like trying to catch your BIOS screen when your computer 
  first boots.  If you can't get this next part to work right, go read the Hack 
  FAQ for more troubleshooting info. This part is not strictly necessary, but 
  helpful. See below.</p>
<p>     Once you have a good hardware serial connection to your TiVo, fire up 
  your favorite terminal program (I used Minicom) and set it to use the serial 
  port, no dialing strings, flow control, or anything, 9600, 8,N,1 (if that doesn't 
  work, try 38400,8,N,1).  Plug your TiVo in and hit enter on your terminal once.  
  The timing is a little tricky here.  I've found that you need to do it within 
  three seconds of plugging in the TiVo.  Your mileage may vary.  Don't wait for 
  the TiVo to start showing graphics. </p>

<p>     At the prompt, use the password &quot;factory&quot;.  Then, select X for 
  &quot;Extended Menu&quot;.  Then select P for &quot;Boot Parameters&quot;.  
  The system will display your current boot parameters.   They will include a 
  reference to either hda4 or hda7. This is your primary boot partition. Remember 
  it for later. Write it down if you have to. Select B to continue booting.<br>
</p>
<p>     If, for some reason, you are not able to get into diagnostic mode to look 
  at your boot settings, you'll have to try to figure out which partition is the 
  primary later on. You can do this by looking at file dates, or perhaps just 
  make all the changes to both partitions.</p>

<p><b><a name="2.3"></a>2.3 Pulling the hard drive</b></p>
<p><b>*WARNING* YOU ARE ABOUT TO VOID YOUR WARRANTY!!!</b></p>
<p>     Place your TiVo (fully disconnected from all cables) on a clean, flat 
  surface. Preferrably a static mat. If you don't have a static mat, be sure you 
  either control or discharge static according to accepted practices. The guts 
  of your TiVo are fragile. On the rear of the unit, you will see three Torx screws. 
  These may be removed with a #8 Torx screwdriver. In a pinch, I've used hex wrenches, 
  but you should really use the right tool for the job. Torx screwdrivers are 
  available at pretty much any hardware store.</p>
<p>     The cover itself is extremely difficult to remove the first time. To remove 
  it, you need to slide it back about an inch, then lift it straight up. To remove 
  mine, I inserted a wide-bladed flathead screwdriver under the lip on the back 
  and gently pried to get it started. Check the Hack FAQ for some other ideas 
  if you're having trouble.</p>
<p>     Using the same Torx driver, remove the two screws holding the A drive 
  down, disconnect the power cable and the IDE cable, and gently remove the drive. 
  It's not necessary to remove the drive from the attached brackets. If you have 
  a two-drive model, you only need the A drive, you won't need the B drive.</p>
<p><b><a name="2.4"></a>2.4 Hi-jacking a spare computer</b></p>
<p>     Before you continue, you will need to either have a working linux computer, 
  or any working computer + a copy of Dylan's Boot Disk (DBD). I recommend using 
  DBD regardless, so you don't run the risk of hosing a perfectly good linux partition 
  if you make a mistake. You can find DBD (which includes the BlessTivo program) 
  at <a href="http://www.tivofaq.com/hack/tivoboot_v3.zip">http://www.tivofaq.com/hack/tivoboot_v3.zip</a><br>
  <br>
       Install the drive into your spare computer on any of the IDE channels <i>except</i> 
  IDE0/Master. The channel you install it on will determine the drive name once 
  we go to mount it, according to the following chart:</p>
<p>IDE0/Slave: /dev/hdb<br>
  IDE1/Master: /dev/hdc<br>
  IDE1/Slave: /dev/hdd</p>
<p>     Boot the computer from your DBD boot disk (according to the instructions 
  included with DBD). When the computer is booted and you have logged in, you 
  should create two directories. Since DBD runs from a virtual ramdisk, these 
  directories will vanish if you reboot, so keep that in mind.</p>
<p>     At the prompt, type these commands (replacing &quot;X&quot; with b, c, 
  or d, according to the chart above):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"># mkdir /mnt/4<br>
    # mkdir /mnt/7<br>
    # mount /dev/hdX4 /mnt/4<br>
    # mount /dev/hdX7 /mnt/7<br>
    </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p>     You should now have your two root partitions mounted and ready to modify. 
  Additional information on this process can be foud in the Hack FAQ.</p>
<p><b><a name="2.5"></a>2.5Getting some tools together</b></p>

<p>      Collect together all the pre-compiled binaries you might need, such as 
  Tridge's rsync from <a href="http://tivo.samba.org/download/tridge">http://tivo.samba.org/download/tridge</a>. 
  You can find some other useful tools such as &quot;diff&quot; and &quot;less&quot; 
  at <a href="http://pvrhack.sonnik.com/tivo/download.asp">http://pvrhack.sonnik.com/tivo/download.asp</a>.</p>
<p><b><a name="2.6"></a>2.6 Copying tools to TiVo</b></p>
<p>     Start by creating a working directory.  I put mine under /var/tivo since 
  the /var partition is mounted read-write in the TiVo and I don't like to keep 
  remounting the root partition during normal operation.  All my modified scripts 
  and my tools go here so I'll have them all in one place.  Plus, it makes rsyncing 
  convenient later. Note that while mounted in the spare PC, the paths would be 
  /mnt/4/var (or /mnt/7/var) and /mnt/4/var/tivo (or /mnt/7/var/tivo).</p>
<p>     While the drive is still mounted in your spare computer, copy over, via 
  floppy disk, any tools you'll need. If you don't at least put rsync on, then 
  you'll have problems transferring files later on. In order to get your tools 
  over to the TiVo after we've finished, we need to use one of three methods, 
  Z-Modem transfer (rz/sz) , http_get, or rsync. Rsync is actually the best way 
  to transfer files, but we can't use it until we have an rsync binary on the 
  TiVo. We'll talk about setting that up later. http_get is a good option, but 
  requires you to be in &quot;tivosh&quot; instead of &quot;bash&quot;, as well 
  as a working web server. Since tivosh seems to crash easily, we want to avoid 
  that until after we have a ppp connection. That just leaves rz/sz. rz/sz *really* 
  doesn't work well with a ppp connection, so we need to get some of our tools 
  (like rsync) copied over while we're still mounted in the spare PC.</p>
<p><b><a name="2.7"></a>2.7  Running pppd over serial</b></p>
<p>     Some of what we want to do won't work right if you do it from your spare 
  PC, so we're going to do this in pieces. First, we'll get the bash prompt working, 
  then we'll go back and change it to PPP later on. Bear with me. <br>
  <br>
       First, we'll need to enable a straight bash prompt over the serial port. 
  For this exercise, we'll assume that the primary boot partition from Section 
  2.2 is hda4. Start by changing directories to /mnt/4/etc/rc.d, like this:</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"># cd /mnt/4/etc/rc.d<br>
    </font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"># cp rc.sysinit rc.sysinit.bak<br>
    # echo &quot;/bin/bash &lt; /dev/ttyS3 &gt;&amp; /dev/ttyS3 &amp;&quot; &gt;&gt; 
    rc.sysinit <br>
    # umount /dev/hdX4 </font><font size="-1">(Change X to the appropriate letter)</font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"><br>
    # umount /dev/hdX7<br>
    # shutdown -h now</font></p>
</blockquote>
  
<p>     Now you can shut everything down and mount the TiVo drive back in the 
  TiVo. When you fire your TiVo back up, you should be able to get a bash prompt. 
  Wait until the boot process is completed, and with your serial connection the 
  same as in Section 2.2, your prompt should appear in your terminal program. 
  If your bash prompt looks screwy (weird wrapping, etc.) try the command &quot;stty 
  echo&quot; or &quot;stty echo cooked&quot;.</p>

	
	
<p>     A bash prompt is all well and good, but we can't really do what we want 
  with a straight serial connection.  We really need to assign the serial port 
  an IP address and run ppp over it.  Not to mention, if you do something weird 
  and end up locking the port, you'll only get it back by doing a reboot.  With 
  pppd over serial, you can telnet in.  If the telnet session locks, you can just 
  start a new session.</p>

<p>         Now, we'll create a device for the serial port and set up some scripts.  
  Enter these lines at your prompt:</p>

<blockquote> 

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">% mount -o rw,remount 
      /<br>
      % cd /sbin <br>
      % cp pppd custpppd <br>
      % cd /dev <br>
      % mknod cua3 c 5 67 <br>
      % cd /etc <br>
      % cp ppp-options ppp-options.bak <br>
      % cat &gt; ppp-options.cua3 <br>
      /dev/cua3 <br>
      115200 <br>
      nocrtscts <br>
      debug<br>
      local<br>
      noauth<br>
      passive<br>
      persist<br>
      nodetach </font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1"><br>
      kdebug 1 <br>
      asyncmap 0 <br>
      netmask 255.255.255.0 <br>
      ^D</font><font size="-1"><br>
      </font> </p>
    </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p> (That last one is Control-D to save and exit) </p>

<p>    That will set up the device node and the options for the serial port, as 
  well as a backup of your pppd (there's a reason, we'll get to it.) You may also 
  wish to add &quot;lcp-restart 1&quot; and &quot;ipcp-restart 1&quot; after &quot;nocrtscts&quot; 
  in the script above. That should make the link slightly more fault tolerant.</p>

<p>Continuing on: <br>

<p>     The two instances of custpppd loading in the script above are necessary 
  because on some units (like mine), it complains that /dev/cua3 doesn't exist 
  when you try to start pppd on it.  If you start a &quot;plain&quot; instance 
  of pppd first, then start a second one for cua3, it works fine.  Go figure.  
  You may find that you don't need the first instance. Also, you'll notice that 
  you now have rc.sysinit (with ppp code), rc.sysinit.bash (with bash code) and 
  rc.sysinit.bak (in case you screw up and need a clean copy). If you need a straight 
  bash prompt again, you can switch between them and reboot.</p>

<p>     You should also copy all these files to your working 

  directory so you have copies if a TiVo software update blows them away:</p>

<blockquote>

  <p>/etc/ppp-options.cua3<br>

    /etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit  (your new, modified one, of course)<br>

    /etc/rc.d/rc.remote-login </p>

</blockquote>

<p> and although not really necessary, you may also want backups of your tools 

  from /devbin. </p>

<p>     Now, reboot your TiVo and it should start up the custpppd 

  program on /dev/ttyS3 (your serial port).  Of course, you won't be able to get 

  your bash prompt until you set up the linux side.</p>

<p>On the linux side: </p>

<blockquote> 

  <blockquote>

    <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">% /usr/sbin/pppd ttyS0 
      115200 noauth debug local nocrtscts 192.168.10.1:192.168.10.2 <br>
      % telnet 192.168.10.2 </font></p>

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>     Of course, ttyS0 should be changed to match your linux serial port and 
  the host:client IP's should be changed to fit your internal LAN as needed. If 
  you do not use a separate subnet for your TiVo, you'll need to add &quot;proxyarp&quot; 
  to the list of settings for pppd. I highly recommend creating another subnet, 
  though, as it simplifies control for networking and firewall rules. Also, if 
  you're having trouble with pppd timing out on the linux side, try adding &quot;lcp-max-configure 
  60&quot; to the pppd line (right after nocrtscts). Change 60 to an appropriate 
  number. The default is 10, which works out to a 30-second timeout. 60 will give 
  it about 3 minutes, which should be more than enough time to get the TiVo booted 
  and connected.</p>

<p>     You should now have a happy bash prompt over telnet.  If you don't want 
  to do updates over always-on internet, you can stop here and just play with 
  telnetting, but you should add the &quot;nodefaultroute&quot; option to ppp-options.cua3, 
  or pppd will die everytime the TiVo calls home.  Remember also, TiVo has NO 
  security.  Make sure your firewall is adequate (but of course, make sure your 
  TiVo still has access out through it...)</p>
<p>    <b><a name="2.8"></a>2.8  Setting up rsync</b></p>
<p>     A big problem with transferring files to and from TiVo 

  is that the included rz and sz (recieve z-modem and send z-modem) don't like 

  telnet very much.  It'll work, but it tends to mangle ASCII files.  Some people 

  have said using the -e option will fix that.  It doesn't work for me.  I prefer 

  to use rsync, but it's a little bit of a pain.  This is verbatim from the Hack 

  FAQ.  I place it here only for convenience.  You should check the FAQ for up-to-date 

  information.</p>

*START QUOTED SECTION*

<p>  Using rsync to transfer files to/from your TiVo</p>

<p>Getting data onto and off your TiVo is made a lot easier using rsync. You can 
  get a TiVo binary of rsync from <a href="http://tivo.samba.org/download/tridge/">http://tivo.samba.org/download/tridge/</a>, 
  then you need to follow these steps to use it: </p>

<p>1) setup PPP to your TiVo. Make sure you can ping. </p>

<p>2) install rsync as a daemon on your Linux box (_not_ on the TiVo). To do this 

  you add a line like this in /etc/inetd.conf: </p>

<blockquote> 

  <blockquote>

    <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">rsync stream tcp nowait 

      root /usr/bin/rsync rsync --daemon</font></p>

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>then send a HUP to inetd like this &quot;killall -1 inetd&quot; </p>

<p>3) create a /etc/rsyncd.conf something like this: </p>

<blockquote> 

  <blockquote> 

    <blockquote>

      <p> <font size="-1" face="Courier New, Courier, mono">[tivo]<br>
        path = /tmp/tivo<br>

        uid = root<br>

        read only = no</font></p>

    </blockquote>

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>You may wish to set &quot;uid=&quot; to your own username rather than root. 
  Then do &quot;mkdir /tmp/tivo&quot; as that user. NOTE: If you are on a open 
  internet connection then the above will have opened the directory /tmp/tivo 
  to the world. See the rsyncd.conf man page for security options.</p>

<p> 4) test your rsync setup locally (ie. without the TiVo). Use a command like: 

</p>

<blockquote> 

  <blockquote>

    <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">rsync -Pavz /etc/hosts 
      localhost::tivo/</font></p>

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

5) You can now transfer files betweem /tmp/tivo on your linux box and your TiVo. 
Note that you must use the IP address if your Linux box in the rsync commands, 
the host name will not work. See the rsync man page for all the options, but the 
following will give you some ideas: 
<blockquote> 

  <blockquote>

    <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">rsync -Pavz /var/log 
      192.168.2.22::tivo/</font></p>

    <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">rsync -Pav 192.168.2.22::tivo/foo 
      /tmp/</font></p>

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

*END QUOTED SECTION* 

<p>I use</p>

<blockquote> 

  <blockquote>

    <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">rsync -Pav 192.168.10.1::tivo/ 
      /var/tivo</font> </p>

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p> to receive files from /tmp/TiVo on my linux box to /var/tivo on my TiVo. The 
  command: </p>

<blockquote> 

  <blockquote> 
    <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">rsync -Pav /var/tivo 
      192.168.10.1::tivo/</font> </p>

  </blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>will send files back to the linux box.</p>

<p> You can try using http_get instead of rz/sz if you like. Here's how:</p>
<p>Assuming your Linux box has some sort of webserver running on it, put the files 
  to be transferred in some web-accessible location, like say /my/webserver/root/tivo-downloads/.</p>
<p>On the TiVo side, run tivosh, then </p>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">% http_get -T 0 -C 0 -D /var/tmp 
  -U http://1.2.3.4:80/tivo-downloads/myfile</font></p>
<p>/var/tmp is the destination on the TiVo side, 1.2.3.4 is the IP address of 
  the target web server (don't forget the :80 since http_get does not default). 
  /tivo-downloads/myfile is the path and file to retrieve. Also, be sure to use 
  the IP address and NOT the DNS name of the web server.</p>

<p><font size="+1"><a name="3"></a>3. Retrieving updates over always-on internet 
  </font> </p>

<p>
<p>    <b><a name="3.1"></a>3.1  Modifying the dialing script</b></p>

<p>     There's really only one step here.  We'll change a 

  script so that it will think it already has an IP address.  This is partly why 

  we run custpppd instead of pppd.  If the script runs and sees pppd running, 

  it will kill it, which will make you lose your connection.</p>

<p>     Start by backing up and then rsyncing /tvlib/tcl/tv/TClient-lib.itcl.  
  If you can figure out how to edit the file right on the TiVo, you can skip rsyncing 
  it and make these modifications right on the TiVo.</p>

<p>     Around line 1350, you should see something like this:</p>

<blockquote> 

  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">putlog &quot;Ird Id.&quot;<br>
      if [catch { svclog &quot;ird_id&quot; &quot;ID=$env(IrdSerialNumber)&quot; 
      }] {<br>
      putlog &quot;IrdSerialNumber not found.&quot;<br>
      }</font></p>
    <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">if [file exists /var/tmp/pppaddr]

      delete object $tcd411<br>
      putlog &quot;PPP has failed, we've warned the user, set status to Failed&quot;<br>
      toggleLed 0<br>
      after 5000</font></p>

    </blockquote>

</blockquote>

Add the line &quot;catch {file delete /var/tmp/pppaddr}&quot; so it looks like 

this: 

<blockquote> 

  <blockquote> 
    <p> <font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">putlog &quot;Ird Id.&quot;<br>
      if [catch { svclog &quot;ird_id&quot; &quot;ID=$env(IrdSerialNumber)&quot; 
      }] {<br>
      putlog &quot;IrdSerialNumber not found.&quot;<br>
      }</font></p>
    <p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono" size="-1">catch {file delete /var/tmp/pppaddr}<br>
      if [file exists /var/tmp/pppaddr] {<br>
      if {[connectPPP $phone $pppUser $pppPass] != 0} {<br>
      delete object $idb<br>
      delete object $tcd411<br>
      putlog &quot;PPP has failed, we've warned the user, set status to Failed&quot;<br>
      toggleLed 0<br>
      after 5000</font></p>

    </blockquote>

</blockquote>

Once that's done, rsync it back and copy it to /tvlib/tcl/tv/. 

<p>You should now be able to disconnect your phone line.  Try running a forced 
  call.  It will try to use the modem, but it will fail and fall back to the existing 
  ppp connection.  The updates are pulled via http, so make sure your firewall 
  rules allow the TiVo out.  TiVo will call out over http (port 80), ftp (port 
  23) and ntp (123) If you like, you can watch it call out.  Telnet to your TiVo 
  and do &quot;tail -f /var/log/tclient&quot;  or &quot;tail -f /var/log/kernel&quot;.</p>
