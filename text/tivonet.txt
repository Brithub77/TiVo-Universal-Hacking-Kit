TiVoNET Floppy - Script by Chris Worley  

This script is in early beta.  Read the script and make sure you understand
and agree with what it is doing before proceeding.

These are the files for a "second disk" for unzipping onto a DOS formatted 
floppy.

It has a script, named "script".  You can edit it from windows notepad
or word, but first run a "unix2dos" utility, and when finished editing,
run a "dos2unix" utility on the script file.  You can get these
utilities at:

When editing, make sure your editor isn't in a "line wrap" mode.  If it 
adds a new line, it might screw up the script.  Also, make sure and 
save script as a text file and not a doc file.

When you are finished editing the script, copy it, along with all of
the files in this zip file (except for this README.txt file) to a DOS 
formatted floppy disk.

Anyway, the script is self explanatory... setup the variables at the top
with a Windows editor, shut down, then put your tivo disk on your PC,
boot "Dylan's boot disk", log in as "root", remove the Dylan Boot Disk
and insert the TiVoNET Floppy Disk and then:

	mkdir /floppy
	mount /dev/fd0 /floppy
	/floppy/script

Which runs the script.

The script will (to both the #4 and #7 partitions) copy the popular
"tivo-bin" tools, including tivoftpd, and the "tkp-tools" in /hack. 
It also sets up your /profile, and renames your "route" command, puts
the serial bash prompt at the end of rc.sysinit, and loads the NIC
modules and configures the interface at the end of rc.sysinit.

With this, the user need not login via the serial port, they should be
able to telnet directly to the new machine.
